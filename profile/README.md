## Overview

DriveDx provides comprehensive <a href="#">drive health monitoring</a> that interprets <a href="#">S.M.A.R.T. data</a> from SSDs and HDDs to predict potential failures before they cause data loss. Understanding drive condition enables proactive protection through timely backup and replacement rather than reactive disaster recovery after failures occur.

<a href="#">S.M.A.R.T. analysis</a> reads self-monitoring data that drives collect about their own operation. Drives track error rates, temperature, wear indicators, and other metrics that reveal developing problems. DriveDx interprets this data meaningfully rather than just displaying raw numbers.

<a href="#">Health indicators</a> translate technical S.M.A.R.T. attributes into understandable assessments. See overall drive health status and specific areas of concern without needing to understand every technical parameter.

<a href="#">SSD wear monitoring</a> tracks solid-state drive lifespan consumption particularly important for SSDs with finite write endurance. Know how much drive life remains and plan replacement appropriately.

<a href="#">Failure prediction</a> identifies drives showing signs of impending failure so you can protect data before problems become catastrophic. Early warning enables orderly data migration rather than emergency recovery.

<a href="#">Background monitoring</a> watches drives continuously without requiring manual checks. DriveDx runs unobtrusively, alerting when attention is needed rather than demanding constant user vigilance.

<a href="#">Multiple drive support</a> monitors internal and external drives connected to your Mac. Track all storage devices from single dashboard for comprehensive awareness.
